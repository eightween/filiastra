### hello world

My name's Sophia! I like to build and test solutions for better API and tooling. I help maintain
[interactions.py](https://github.com/interactions-py) on the side while testing cool project ideas.

My current public project is [dcswd](https://github.com/filiastra/dcswd), (pinned below) focused
on documenting and expanding existing knowledge on DCS World's Lua API. The goal of this project is to
help enable developers have a better understanding on flyable plugins.
[dcswd-template](https://github.com/filiastra/dcswd-template) is a complementary project to help
developers get a quickstart on modding for DCS World.
